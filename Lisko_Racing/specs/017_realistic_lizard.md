# Realistic Lizard Update

## Request
Tee liskosta realistinen (Make the lizard realistic)

## Changes
- Completely rebuilt the lizard model using a segmented approach (Hips, Chest, Head) to allow for organic movement.
- Added detailed geometry:
    - Bulging eyes with pupils.
    - Segmented tail with ridges.
    - Articulated legs with shoulders, upper/lower sections, feet, and claws.
    - Two-tone skin (seagreen body, light green belly).
- Implemented realistic animation:
    - **Spine Undulation (S-Curve):** The body segments now rotate in a wave pattern like a real reptile.
    - **Tail Wave:** The tail follows the spine's motion with a lag for fluid movement.
    - **Gait Sync:** Legs move in a proper trot gait synchronized with the spine bending.
    - **Head Stabilization:** The head counter-rotates slightly to stay focused forward while the body wiggles.
